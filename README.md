# Time Microservice

As part of this week's lesson, you completed a "time" microservice and deployed it to Heroku. We will be grading this assignment based purely on your completion of the guided activities associated with this project.

Please submit a link to your microservice, as it's deployed on Heroku. For example, you might submit a link like http://my-app234123.herokuapp.com/ .

Please also zip your project directory into an archive and submit it here as a file upload.
